Welcome to smis!
========================================================================================================================

smis is a small library that allows |python|_ applications to access the |mis|, which provides a REST API to retrieve
information from a published |iw|_ model. The purpose of this library is to demonstrate how applications can access the
|mis|, and it serves as an example for other applications to integrate the service. Still, the goal is to  provide a
fully functional library that can be use in your |python|_ applications to integrate with |mis|.

..  important::

    The |mis| is currently in preview mode, and it is subject to change. We are looking for developers that will like
    to integrate the service with their applications and provide us with feedback about the service. It is important to
    understand applications that integrate the service might be broken in the future when APIs and representations
    change, and that Autodesk will not be responsible for any problems caused by changes in the service. The following
    describes the terms of service of the library and its source code.
