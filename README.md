# smis
The ``smis`` package provides an interface to the Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Model Information Service, which exposes
a REST API to retrieve model information from published Autodesk InfraWorks 360 models. ``smis`` simplifies access
to the service by providing a simple interface that returns resources as Python objects, which can be easily
manipulated, and abstracting the REST HTTP calls required to access the service. For more information, visit the
[documentation page](http://simple-mis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
